Adds in the Starship Enterprise to BloonsTD6 with 7 Upgrade Paths that have 6 Upgrades each.

The main 3 paths are Enterprise's weapons: Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, and Phase Cannons.

The next 3 paths are the Career Paths, letting you specialize in Tactical, Science or Engineering, with standard X/2/0 restrictions.

The final path is the refit model, taking the Enterprise from Constitution Class all the way to Odyssey Class, and always available for upgrading.

Requires Paths++
